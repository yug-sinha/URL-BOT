# URL Scraping Chatbot

This project is a URL scraping chatbot application built with React, Django, and other modern technologies. The chatbot allows users to input a URL, scrape data from the specified website, and interact with a chatbot that provides responses based on the scraped data.

## Technologies Used

1. **React**
   - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
  
2. **TypeScript**
   - A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language, enhancing the development experience.

3. **Django**
   - A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design for building web applications.

4. **FastAPI**
   - A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python, known for its performance and ease of use.

5. **ChromaDB**
   - A vector database designed for machine learning and AI applications, used for efficient storage and retrieval of data.

6. **Google Gemini API**
   - An AI-powered API from Google for natural language processing and interaction capabilities.

7. **CSS**
   - A stylesheet language used for styling the application.

8. **HTML**
   - The standard markup language for creating web pages, used to define the structure of the application.

9. **JavaScript**
    - The programming language enabling interactive web pages and dynamic functionality.

10. **Fetch API**
    - A modern interface for making HTTP requests in JavaScript, used for communicating with the backend.

11. **npm (Node Package Manager)**
    - A package manager for JavaScript, used to manage project dependencies.

12. **Version Control (e.g., Git)**
    - A system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing for version control and collaboration.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (for the frontend)
- **Python 3.x** (for the backend)
- **pip** (Python package manager)

   ```

### Setting Up the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
